# Commit Workflow

## Lint Before Committing

**Always run `bun run lint` before committing.** Fix any lint errors before staging and committing changes.

```bash
bun run lint
```

If lint fails, fix the errors, then run format and lint again before committing:

```bash
bun run format
bun run lint
```

Only commit when lint passes with 0 errors.
